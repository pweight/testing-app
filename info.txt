Planning doc for new Nerd Core endpoints that will simplify account creation for other brands and for creating a standard wallet that each brand can use.

What items do we need?
--- Account Creation:

-Databases - Connect_Membership_Partners
SignUpEndpoint - Update or new Column?
?? LoginEndpoint - Update or new Column?

Connect_Membership_PartnerUserIds
    PartnerMemberId - now the Core id

Potential changes to sign up flows
1. Normal signup for Connect and/or linking accounts
2. User selects the auto linking for the brand that they want
    1a/2a. Have one endpoint for creation that passes in their info and brands they want to sign up.
        a. Do we wait for this to finish or fire off some tasks/topics for creating these new accounts.
        b. Make sure we insert these connections in to partnerUserIds to indicate we are tied to them
3. Verify Email - Just for connect?  Or for each brand?

Potential Gotchas and Questions???
    What if they use the brand website to reset their password?  
    Does that affect linking usage and if we want to send them to the brand site and for logging in?  
    Will those endpoints be unified?


--- Wallet Creation:

After sign up process
Get list of accounts that were selected from partnerUserIds
1. Setup wallet passcode and recovery phrase
    1.a. Can we have a cooler recovery phrase click to put in order or drag and drop???
2. Call for each brand account that was Setup


How do we handle error states?  Do we get enough information back to show what is wrong?

Do we need a new brand management page or something we can add management views.
